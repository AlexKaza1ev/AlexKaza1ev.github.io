		<p>My name is Alex Kazaiev and I love to create stuff.</p>
		<p>As an antidote for the burnout from my 9 to 5 (it's 7 to 6, but who counts) I'm exploring hobbyist electronics, microcontrollers and 3D printing.</p>
		<p>This is more of a personal project notes pile rather than anything else.</p>
		<p>Thanks for stoping by :)</p>

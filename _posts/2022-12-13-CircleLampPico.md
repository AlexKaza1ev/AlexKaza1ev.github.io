I was in need of a light source, something like the night lamp, for quite some time. I wasn't really looking and found [this thing on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4690555).

I had a couple of meters of the LED strip laying around as well as a Raspbery Pi Pico. I also wanted to modify the original a little bit so it would run some of those fantastic animations
that you can basically get for free with the Adafruit LED animation library.

I added a couple of buttons, one for brightness level and one to cycle through off/on/animation mode.

My little modifications are here at [CircleLampPico](https://github.com/AlexKaza1ev/CircleLampPico) repo. I only uploaded the changed files, you can find the originals here -> [CircleLamp](https://github.com/mistic100/CircleLamp)

A long time ago I wrote a small app in C#, the idea was to manipulate Windows registry to make a folder appear as a physical drive. As far as I can remember, I wanted it for my DropBox setup. It had a glorious "intuitive" UI straight from early 2000s with, like, 3 buttons and a list of "mounted" drives. That was my first stab at open source - I hosted it on CodePlex, kind of gives you and idea about how long ago it was. At its peak, it had a couple of thousands of users.

Now, after all those years, both sources and the binary package are lost, can't say I miss it or anything. However, just recently I got an email from Free Download Manager (another relic of the past long gone), my app received an award!

Incredible! Hooray to automated awards! ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
